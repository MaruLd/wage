### Project context

Uni Incubator Compensation and Benefit (Uni CnB) is a product in the Uni Incubator ecosystem that helps to manage projects, record and calculate allowances and benefits for participating members. It serves as a management tool for internal compensation and benefit calculations within the Uni Incubator, aiding in the recognition of members' contributions rather than serving as a means of paying members' salaries. At the same time, it serves as a connecting mechanism for startup projects and sponsors. The aim of Uni CnB is to handle a tool for calculating benefits based on participating members' contributions as well as to manage and pay out subsidies to them.
